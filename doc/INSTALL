This file describes the steps to be carried out for installing the PlantUML plugin for Gedit3.

========================================================================================================================
PREREQUISITS
========================================================================================================================
Graphviz needs to be installed prior to using the plugin, since PlantUML relies on it. Please download Graphviz from
http://www.graphviz.org for your operating system or, on linux, install it using your package manager.

Of course, Gedit3 needs to be installed as well. It can be obtained from http://www.gedit.org


========================================================================================================================
INSTALLING PLUGIN ON LINUX
========================================================================================================================
Extract the obtained archive and copy the contents of the folder /src to your personal folder:
/home/username/.local/share/gedit/plugins 

For a system-wide installation it should be copied to:
/usr/share/gedit/plugins.


========================================================================================================================
INSTALLING PLUGIN ON WINDOWS
========================================================================================================================
As far as I know the most recent installer for Windows is for Gedit v2.30. This means that the plugin is not usable on
Windows yet. This is very unfortunate, since I would love to use it on my Windows PC at my work.

I’ve already tried to compile Gedit3 for Windows. Once while using Cygwin (on Windows), and once as cross-compilation on
Linux using mingw32. Unfortunately both without (quick enough) success. A later try with MSYS2 (also on Windows) as was
suggested on Nacho’s Blog did succeed for Gedit v3.14, yet I still have to get the plugin working for this version.

========================================================================================================================
INSTALLING PLUGIN ON OSX
========================================================================================================================
I’ve got no idea. I haven’t looked into this, but I expect it to be similar to Linux.
